# Atlas Agent Runtime SDK

## Purpose-Built Simplicity. Enterprise-Grade Intelligence.

The **Agent Runtime SDK** is a focused, high-impact framework engineered for one purpose:
**To make building AI agents fast, simple, and directly integrated into your MCP infrastructure.**

This is not a bulky AI orchestration platform. It is a lean, developer-first toolkit designed to bring intelligent agents to life—**without the complexity** of traditional frameworks.

Whether you're managing autonomous systems, streamlining mission control, or operationalizing internal tools, **Agent Runtime SDK enables rapid agent deployment that just works**.


## What Sets It Apart

* **Native MCP Integration**
  Built from the ground up to integrate directly with your MCP servers. No workarounds. No wrappers.

* **Minimal Code. Maximum Clarity.**
  Define, configure, and run agents in minutes—with full control over behavior and toolsets.

* **Prompt-Centric Design**
  Shape your agent’s logic through natural language. Adjust strategy or tone without touching core logic.

* **Composable & Extendable**
  Easily plug in APIs, tools, and services. The architecture is clean, modular, and enterprise-ready.

* **Not Another LangChain**
  We're not trying to compete with LangChain, Strands, or Google ADK. We're delivering something different:
  **a streamlined solution for teams who know exactly what they need.**


## Real-World Simplicity

```python
from ai_agent_sdk import Agent, MCPClient

# Connect your agent to the MCP server with a prompt that defines behavior
agent = Agent(
    tools=[MCPClient(url="https://example.com", headers={"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"})],
    prompt="You are an intelligent assistant managing drone missions."
)

# Interact with the agent using natural input
response = agent("Get the latest mission status")

print(response)
```

No pipelines to configure. No hidden abstractions. Just results.


## Where It Belongs

The Agent Runtime SDK is purpose-built for:

* Engineering teams building AI capabilities into **mission-critical systems**
* Enterprise environments where **speed, reliability, and precision** matter
* Projects where **MCP integration is non-negotiable**
* Development teams who want full control without vendor lock-in or architectural bloat


## Why It Matters

In today’s AI landscape, speed to value is everything.
The Agent Runtime SDK cuts through the noise—**no inflated architectures, no unnecessary layers, no AI theatre**. It gives your team the ability to build and deploy real agents, right now, with the systems you already have.

If you’re building for performance, clarity, and enterprise alignment, this is your tool.
