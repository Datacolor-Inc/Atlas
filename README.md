# Datacolor Atlas

**Datacolor Atlas** – our framework for accelerating enterprise-grade AI agent development.

---

## Why

As enterprises adopt AI agents at scale, the challenge is less about core LLM capabilities and more about securely, reliably, and efficiently integrating agents with business systems like **SAP, Salesforce, and Informatica, etc.**.  

**Datacolor Atlas** addresses this **“last mile”** need by providing a **consistent and reusable way to build, orchestrate, and deploy agentic workflows** across diverse environments.

---

## What

Datacolor Atlas is a **modular framework of reusable components** and its key components include

- **Agent Runtime SDK** – Lightweight libraries to bootstrap conversational or autonomous agents.  
- **MCP Server Kit** – Templates to stand up MCP servers on any hyperscaler, with automation for tool and tool-definition onboarding.  
- **Tool & Tool Definition Library** – A library to rapidly define/deploy tools and standardize request/response formats across integration points.  

These components have already proven integral in enabling workflows that **read, write, and trigger actions** in many business-critical applications like SAP, Salesforce, Informatica, Atlassian, etc..

This framework complements—rather than replaces—open-source agent frameworks such as **LangChain** or **Strand**.

## How This Helps Us

By keeping Atlas deployable on **any hyperscaler platform**, we can leverage their respective native capabilities in areas such as,  

- **Observability** – Provides real-time visibility into agent workflows with logs, metrics, and traces, enabling monitoring, debugging, and compliance reporting.
- **Identity** – Ensures secure authentication and role-based access control so agents act with enterprise-grade trust and accountability.
- **Memory** – Equips agents with short-term and long-term context retention, improving relevance, personalization, and continuity across tasks.
- **Runtime** – A portable execution layer that orchestrates agent lifecycles, workflows, and tool interactions consistently.
- **Guardrails** – Embeds policy enforcement, safety checks, and governance controls to prevent misuse and ensure alignment with enterprise standards.
- **Performance Optimization** – Continuously tunes workloads, resource allocation, and response latencies for cost efficiency and high throughput at scale. 

This portability ensures:  

- ⚡ **Faster time-to-value** for AI agent projects  
- 🔒 **Reliable and secure orchestration** across enterprise applications  
- 📈 **Scalable adoption** that meets enterprise-grade standards
