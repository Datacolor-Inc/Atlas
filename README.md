# Datacolor Atlas

**Datacolor Atlas** – our framework for accelerating enterprise-grade AI agent development.

---

## Why

As enterprises adopt AI agents at scale, the challenge is less about core LLM capabilities and more about securely, reliably, and efficiently integrating agents with business systems like **SAP, Salesforce, and Informatica. etc.**.  

**Datacolor Atlas** addresses this **“last mile”** need by providing a **consistent and reusable way to build, orchestrate, and deploy agentic workflows** across diverse environments.

---

## What

Datacolor Atlas is a **modular framework of reusable components** that complements—rather than replaces—open-source agent frameworks such as **LangChain** or **Strand**.  

Its key components include:

- **Agent Runtime SDK** – Lightweight libraries to bootstrap conversational or autonomous agents.  
- **MCP Server Kit** – Templates to stand up MCP servers on any hyperscaler, with automation for tool and tool-definition onboarding.  
- **Tool & Tool Definition Library** – A library to rapidly define/deploy tools and standardize request/response formats across integration points.  

These components have already proven integral in enabling workflows that **read, write, and trigger actions** in business-critical applications like SAP, Salesforce, and IDMC.

## How This Helps Us

By keeping Atlas deployable on **any hyperscaler platform**, we can leverage their native capabilities:  

- Observability  
- Identity  
- Memory  
- Runtime  
- Guardrails  
- Performance Optimization  

This portability ensures:  

- ⚡ **Faster time-to-value** for AI agent projects  
- 🔒 **Reliable and secure orchestration** across enterprise applications  
- 📈 **Scalable adoption** that meets enterprise-grade standards
